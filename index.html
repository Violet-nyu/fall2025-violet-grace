    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to... whatever I decide to call this project!</p>
    <p>My name is Violet, and I'm one of the players in Benton's home game playtest of his<a href="https://incunabuli.com/">INCUNABULI</a>system. I recently decided to start keeping detailed notes and writing session summaries for the group, and thought it would be fun to write those up and share them with the public. This project is what came of that decision.</p>
    <p>We have been playing for a long time, and I don't have detailed notes for the whole time. I have prepared a less detailed summary of the early parts of the campaign, then have started splitting more recent events into arcs. Beginning in the Sanitarium arc, each chapter is a single session, with the description of events pulled directly from my notes and summary.</p>
    <p>For now, only the Sanitarium arc is fully written and included, but there are pages for the prologue and Port Julep arcs, to show how pages for different arcs connect.</p>
