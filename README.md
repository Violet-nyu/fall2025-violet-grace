I am mostly planning to use a multi-page structure, though I may hybridize for the linked additional content on each page, depending on exactly how I decide that I would like to do that. The basic structure of each page will be similar, with some differences based on the specific content of each page.
For now, I have created pages for my home page, a character information list, and two prologue sections (Port Julep is also a prologue, but more detailed than the general prologue). Later, there will be new pages for new arcs, and potentially for individual chapters. Each page will have a link to the prologue, to the full dramatis personae page, to the index page, and to the page with the part of the story immediately preceding and immediately following the current page. The index will include links to all pages, acting as a sort of table of contents or, well, index.
I believe that my basic structure should be quite simple, but some of the features I'd like to include might be challenging to implement. There will also, I'm sure, be unexpected difficulties in developing parts of my structure and putting together style in a way that satisfies me.
