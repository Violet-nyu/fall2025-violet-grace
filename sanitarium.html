      <h1>A Showdown at the Sanitarium!</h1>
      <div id="chapter1">
        <h2 id="c1">Chapter 1: Arrival in Aix-en-Montagne</h2>
        <p>Notice sent to the people we were to meet with, we head to the train station and book ourselves two cars on the first train out, at 7 am. That leaves us four hours, so we go and get baths to get ourselves cleaned up, then we head back and get on the train. During the ride, we nap, and hope for an opportunity to get something to eat. After we arrive, we go looking for a heartier breakfast and start trying to locate Saint Gothelo sur la Montagne, familiarizing ourselves with Since. We are pointed towards a carriage company, so we hire a stage to take us to and from the sanitarium. After a few hours, we arrive in Aix-en-Montagne, the town which houses the sanitarium. We arrive near dark and set about finding an inn and directions to the sanitarium. We hear that no one has been going in or out for some time, and they say that it's closed to stop the spread of disease. Things have gone sharply downhill since a new administrator took over two years ago. The inkeeper who tells us about the sanitarium mentions that her daughter, Lena Chenemus, is in the sanitarium for her epilepsy, but she has been unable to visit her for some time and would appreciate it if we can get her out. The sanitarium is built up the road, at a low point of the mountain, about an hour's walk away.</p>
        <p>We pick up a bit of gear, then head out as darkness starts to fall. The walk is uneventful, and we find the asylum, right where we were told it would be. It is comprised of two wings stretching out from a central hall with two sharply peaked towers. The northern wing has lights in various windows, the southern is dark and heavily boarded in the two upper stories. The whole building is clearly in disrepair, with patchy windows, dirty bricks, tattered sun shades, and peeling paint. From Helene's knowledge, there are six wards, three on either side, with the patients closest to rehabilitation closest to the center, and those most unmanageable to the outer ends. Basil's knowledge, Saint Gothelo is the patron saint of lunatics, known to have cured many lunatics, sainted posthumously after being burned at the stake.</p>
        <p>We decide that the best approach is likely sneaking inside, and being prepared to fight our way out if needed. Investigating the gatehouse, we find a guardhouse to the north, with soot around the window and eaves of the roof, indicating a fire, and a carriage house to the south. Herb sneaks closer, investigating the gatehouse and prying open a door to let us in through the burnt-out door. Inside is a desk with a typewriter, covered with papers. A stove seems to have been the source of the fire, with the door and wall around it heavily scorched, but the fire seems to have been put out with water before it could spread too much further. The papers indicate that all activity in this building stopped about 8 months ago, which would likely be the time of the fire. We take a map from its place framed on the wall, and notice that there seems to have been another map segment that was already removed.</p>
        <p>The grounds are all run down and overgrown, the statues covered in moss and the ponds covered in duckweed. There is a hedge, the only kempt element of the grounds we can see, as high as the second story windows, surrounding the entire building as well as two smaller gardens. The map indicates an underground boiler room, connected by tunnels to the main building, so we head towards it to investigate for a potential entry point. As we do, we see a creature, initially mistaking it for a haystack before it rises to a height of nearly seven feet and we see that it is wearing a skull mask over a long beak, with shards of bone sticking out and coating its back. Milo recognizes it as a rattleshake, a bone collector. No one knows where they come from, but they arrive in the trail of killers, producers of a great deal of bones, and are not hostile so long as they continue to be provided with bones. This one has a notably high proportion of white, unplagued, bones. This one heads off into the mountains, for now, and we continue on our way. At the smokestack, we find smokestack, a kerosene hatch, and an unadorned staircase, with a very heavy handleless steel door. The hatch and door are both nigh-impossible to breach quietly with the tools we have on hand, unless we can find the inch-wide hex key to open the hatch, so we decide to investigate more, and likely use a different entry point.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapter2">
        <h2 id="c2">Chapter 2: Meeting the Morons</h2>
        <p>We decide to check out behind the building, where we find a building surrounded with thoroughly salted ground, with a hastella in its wall. This is a crematorium. We poke inside to investigate, provoking squealing and a flurry of movement as a colony of bats is startled by our arrival and rushes to escape. There does not seem to be anything of note in here beyond the bats. From here, a path leads to the sanitarium, where a gate in the hedge could perhaps provide a point of entry. As we approach the hedge, we notice lumpen, slightly transluscent, berries sprouting from something with black leaves inside the hedge. Milo recognizes these as black nettle plants, an imported species which requires nearly no light, with militant pixies. The black nettle sting is known to be the most painful non-lethal plant sting.</p>
        <p>Investigating, we notice that the lock reads "Finch & Gordon", a concerning piece of information, but with careful preparation Basil prepares to pick the lock, while we look for other options for a point of entry. Reed finds a groundskeeper's shed and loppers we can use to cut our way through the hedge, so we make our way to the uninhabited south wing to cut our way through the hedge. We cut a hole large enough to allow us to, with caution, make it through the hedge, so we set off to find a door, which we procede to break through, providing us with entry in the abandoned wing of the sanitarium. As we do, a pair of guards round the corner, stopping when they see us. Alkin opens fire, punching through one of the guards' armor to land a flechette in their neck. The guards turn to flee, but Alkin pursues, closing distance and, as able, pausing to take shots at the backs of the fleeing guards. Eventually, one turns to fight, severely wounded and quickly falling, while the other continues to flee with a flechette wound in their back.</p>
        <p>Once Alkin returns, we enter, finding ourselves under a set of stairs, and we smell hot milk and fire. Herb creeps closer, and hears voices coming from the dining room, joined shortly by Helene to identify the words being spoken. We decide to leave them be for now, moving to try to pick the lock and continue on our way, but one of the people, a ragwoman wearing the remains of a straight jacket, who screams at the sight of us and drops the dirty bowls she was carrying. Another person, a large man also wearing the remains of a straight jacket, approaches us. He introduces himself as Thaddeus and we talk. We explain our intent and express willingness to take any inmates with us now that we've seen the state of the sanitarium, and Thaddeus tells us that Maristan is in solitary with firemoth disease - which causes its sufferers to feel an urge to self-immolate - and that the doctor and the guards he has done something to to ensure loyalty have taken up residence on the second floor. After talking some more and meeting the rest of the remaining group of the insane, we formulate a plan to take on the doctor and the guards, as well as their six cobbenhunden, then leave them as we procede through towards the center to find the doctor's group and any other remaining inmates. As we do, we see someone messing with cirtuitry in the walls, but he electrocutes himself and we decide we don't particularly care.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapter3">
        <h2 id="c3">Chapter 3: A Deal with the Doctor</h2>
        <p>Continuing on, we move further into the sanitarium, investigating some mostly uneventful rooms, before eventually Herb finds a small, mostly naked and hairless, mouse. After impressing him and convincing him that she is an engineer, Herb hears a bit of information from him and is conscripted into holding something in place while he welds it. After talking a bit, Herb excuses herself with the excuse of going to use the restroom, and we move forward to investigate the gate into the central section of the sanitarium. A trap breaks the pick in the lock and renders the lock inoperable, but we bust through and advance further. As we do, we hit a tripwire and trigger an alarm, so we pull back behind the gate and ready ourselves for a fight, and two guards and two cobbenhunden round the corner.</p>
        <p>We fire a volley of flechettes as they round the corner, landing several shots in one of the cobbenhunden before the guards duck back around the corner. They call to ask what we're doing, and after some brief internal chaos Helene calls back that we were sent to inspect the sanitarium and found ourselves decidedly unimpressed. The guards offer to take us to the doctor to find a better resolution for this, and, despite Alkin's hesitance, we agree. An elevator full of six more guards comes down to meet us, and we shuffle in, leaving four of the guards and the remaining cobbenhund.</p>
        <p>A great lightning rod has been thrust through the building, allowing water to drip through around it. At the top of the elevator, we find the doctor, bent over Maristan and surrounded by more guards, these with wires connected to their foreheads. We begin to speak with him, and he discusses his work. He has spent the last fortnight preparing Maristan for something in the doctor's work, something relating to the organ which allows humans to connect to Aveth, including the use of speakers. The doctor offers to trade him to us for one of our own, or two others. We say that we will find two people, and be back within the week, and make our way out.</p>
        <p>As soon as we are out, we start talking about plans for how we can backstab and murder the doctor. The attic in which we met the doctor was about 4 stories above the ground, with a decaying roof and a great west-facing window. When we were there, the guards present were all clumped around the lightning rod, near the window. While there is no guarantee they will be there when we strike, but it is something to keep in mind. With a rope ladder, a couple members of our group should be more than capable of scaling the exterior of the sanitarium, then drop a rope ladder for the rest of us. From the roof, we could enter through either the roof or the window, and could very effectively utilize flashbombs to stun the guards as we breach. We might be able to cut the building's power, and doing so probably should involve Huron and leverage his expertise, and the entire prospect is uncertain.</p>
        <p>Our basic plan decided, we set off towards town to buy a rope ladder, and perhaps some additional supplies, depending on what is available.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapter4">
        <h2 id="c4">Chapter 4: Preparation and Planning</h2>
        <p>We treck back to town, spending several hours walking through the cold and harsh conditions, arriving back around perhaps 6 am in Aix-en-Montagne, heading back to the inn. Outside the inn we see a white wagon, marked for Saint Gothelo, enclosed and with an empty, but listening through the wall with her Earhorn bone, Helene guesses that there are approximately a half-dozen people in the back. We investigate a bit and Basil attempts to pick the lock unsuccessfully, causing someone inside to scream at the top of their lungs. Moving on, we head into the inn.</p>
        <p>Inside, we see some of the guards eating at the bar and Alkin approaches, accompanied by Milo to translate, and a pair of strange characters by the hearth, who Helene approaches. The guards say to leave them be, that they're working, on hospital business, and the conversation does not go anywhere. The ragwoman approaches, identifies herself as a very high-ranking member of Peridot Firm, and asks us if we are a different group of cutters, who she is waiting for for a job, and seems displeased when we are not them. Reed recognizes the name of the other cutter as someone who was also around Port Julep, and seems to be leading another team operating in the region. The other is a mountain climber, waiting for friends with whom he intends to climb the mountain.</p>
        <p>Reed steps outside with Gisele to give her a quick update, before rejoining the rest of us for our lunch. Basil approaches the ragwoman and Laszlo, the mountain climber, and asks about taking them to see the town. The ragwoman intuits that Basil perhaps has ill intentions and advises Laszlo that he does not wish to be here. They head up to their rooms and the guards get up to leave. As they do, Alkin strides up and decapitates both of them in a single strike, making rather a mess of the floor. We all move to start cleaning up, intending to take their wagon a little ways out of town to open up the back and figure out what we want to do with the people in there.</p>
        <p>We efficiently take the bodies out back, where Helene checks their pockets and Helene and Reed dismember the corpses. We find a letter of transfer of employment for four people from T.S. Dufour in Montlorient, something which we would consider effectively indentured servitude, and when a tween comes back from taking care of the horses. Helene says that they had to hurry away on business, and left us to take care of it, gives her a guilder, and sends her on her way. We make a quick run to the outfitters to pick up some gear, bringing back two rope ladders, 50 meters of rope, and a couple of sledgehammers, take a quick nap, and head out.</p>
        <p>Outside of town, we find good spot to open up the back, and open it to find a few people in muzzles. A paper on the door states that they have pseudo-bansheeism. We give one a pen and paper and he writes his name and that they aren't banshees, it's the lead, from basphory lead, which Helene confirms, and identifies as non-communicable. After a bit of discussion, we say that we have no intention to hand them over to the doctor, offer to introduce them to the Morons, and take them back to the castle with us where we can see if any of our companions can do anything more for them and we could retain them for our staff, potentially to be joined by anyone else we like from the sanitarium.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapter5">
        <h2 id="c5">Chapter 5: Storming the Sanitarium</h2>
        <p>On the way to the Sanitarium, we engaged in some strategy discussion, working to create a strategy moving forward. We arrange gear to put Milo and Reed in the full mercenary get-up, letting the two of them hopefully pass themselves off as guards at the sanitarium. We plan to first return to the south wing, to find the Morons again and leave the pseudo-banshees with them, and check Doctor Huron's previous office to see if he is present and able to offer any useful expertise on the electrical systems of the place, see if we can learn where solitary is within the building. Then we will check the north wing for the other people of interest, a quick sweep to find any other inmates we are interested in, while Basil goes to see if he can discern whether Maristan is in the Doctor's attic office. If Maristan is present, we need to clear the office and take him, if not we can likely extract him from solitary with more subtlety.</p>
        <p>As we approach the sanitarium, we see four of the vigilantes, the guards, at the front gate in the hedge, but Milo and Reed are able to get us through the door past them. Inside, we find a pair of orderlies who are satisifed that the doctor is hiring cutters for his dirty work and let us into the ward for the insane, where we make our way through towards where we originally found the Morons, and Doctor Huron. Helene knocks on the door to the Morons' room, and we introduce the pseudo-banshees and tell them our basic plan, checking in with the morons and leaving the pseudo-banshees with them while we prepare to go clear the rest of the sanitarium and recover Maristan.</p>
        <p>Our next stop is in the parlour that has been repurposed into Huron's office, to see what we can learn from him and finalize our plan. We find him, and he is able to tell us some about Gisbert's work, and that it seems that he is trying to reset Maristan's memory. The power plant is at the northern end of the facility, effectively unable to be accessed from the outside and internally accessed from the far end of the ward for the convalescents, and the experiment is not reliant on the building's power. Huron has the capacity to overload the electrical system in an area and kill any vigilantes charging in that room from the central power station and knows that the charging in the lab happens in shifts at 9 am and 9 pm, so we make a plan to strike the power station shortly before 9 pm, seize control, then go get into position around the lab to breach through the window when the guards are electrocuted.</p>
        <p>Basil goes to scout, finding Maristan up in the lab, near the lightning rod, the metal skull bone fitted to his head as the doctor sits in an armchair and reads a document, eating pickled eggs, as two vigilantes move in the room and set up equipment of some sort. As Basil is returning, the snow picks up and we hear thunder in the distance, and we decide to pick up the pace and finish this before the storm can arrive. Basil ascends back up to outside  the window while the rest of us walk up and take the elevator up to the attic, with the plan for Basil to shoot the doctor in the back of the head as the rest of us arrive.</p>
        <p>The elevator clatters up to the attic, as we arrive, two vigilantes step out of doors along the hall. Basil is in position and a single shot from him punches through the window and blows the doctor's head open as the rest of us open fire against the guards. Helene calls shots for Milo and Reed while Alkin puts one shot into the unarmored forearm of one guard and two into the other. Milo and Reed advance and put another flechette into one guard, shortly before three more vigilantes, each with a cobbhund, and they order their cobbenhunden forward to attack, to mixed results. After a brief, violent, exchange, we down all of the guards and their cobbenhunden, then inspect the room.</p>
        <p>Maristan is semi-conscious and there are pages of notes and books on the table next to the doctor. The contents of the notes are complex in a way that we cannot comprehend, lacking the requisite knowledge of neuroscience and medicine. Helene gathers the doctor's books and Basil disconnects Maristan from the lightning rod, then quickly check the rooms along the hall, confirming that they are empty and collecting the high-quality 12-capacity magazine and the clearly homemade coil that accompanies them. After a few minutes, the elevator starts to move, so we prepare some cover and Alkin waits until the elevator has nearly arrived, then primes and drops a grenade and sprints back to cover. The grenade detonates as the elevator full of five guards, seeming ready for a fight but not necessarily looking to initiate, and kills all of the remaining guards. We gather into the elevator to go collect the Morons and the pseudo-banshees and be on our way.</p>
